## Abogical

An obsession with anything 'logical' led him to create the _'Abogical'_ pseudonym that he goes by. This obsession includes subjects related to mathematics and _(suprise)_ computers. It's reported that this CD icon is a relic of his [LittleBigPlanet days](https://web.archive.org/web/20121103084209/https://lbp.me/u/abody_xplay1), however he hasn't confirmed this as of yet.

His ramblings has been gathered as a blog at this site. Contact him if you're curious with the links below.
