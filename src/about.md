An obsession with anything 'logical' led him to create the _'Abogical'_ pseudonym that he goes by. This obsession includes subjects related to mathematics and _(suprise)_ computers. It's reported that this CD icon is a relic of his [LittleBigPlanet days](https://lbp.me/u/abody_xplay1), however he hasn't confirmed this as of yet.

Judging by his git commit history, he seems to have a knack for learning things by throwing the code he learns to FOSS projects. Most popular projects he contributed to include:

-   [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AAbogical+is%3Aclosed)
-   [KDE](https://invent.kde.org/users/abogical/activity)
-   [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AAbogical)

That's all we have on him for now. We'll gather his ramblings as a blog at this site soon. Contact him if you're curious with the links below.
