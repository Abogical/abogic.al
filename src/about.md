## Abogical

An obsession with anything 'logical' led him to create the _'Abogical'_ pseudonym that he goes by. This obsession includes subjects related to mathematics and _(suprise)_ computers. It's reported that this CD icon is a relic of his [LittleBigPlanet days](https://lbp.me/u/abody_xplay1), however he hasn't confirmed this as of yet.

## What he did

Starting from 2015, he started creating desktop applications on Linux using GTK+ & Qt. Applying this experience [into the real world](https://github.com/Grumbel/jstest-gtk/pull/8). Steadily getting more involved in the free & open source community as he learns his way.

Using his Python experience, he's thrown enough code to [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AAbogical+is%3Aclosed) to be able to write his name into their [AUTHORS](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/master/AUTHORS) file. Attempting to make a GTK+ [GUI front-end](https://github.com/Abogical/borg-gtk) for BorgBackup too.

His freelancing career started from 2016. From the little time he has left from his college studies, he successfully accomplished his jobs at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01c08550e06312dd43/) and [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/people/46541-abogical). Latter of which was on [BorgBackup bounties](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ABountysource+abogical+is%3Aclosed). Former of which is awarded 5-star reviews on all his jobs so far.

From 2018, He put more of his effort onto web development. Reading a [few](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484224625) [books](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691), he mastered the basics of HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript. By [volunteering for the IEEE SSCS AlexSC](https://sscsalex.org/bio/abogical), his JavaScript experience grew. Introducing him to React, Gatsby and the JAMStack architecture to produce [their site](https://sscsalex.org).

You may find his code in other projects including:

-   [KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AAbogical)
-   [RedoxOS](https://github.com/redox-os/netutils/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AAbogical)
